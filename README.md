## Information
With this plugin, you can very easily make automatic broadcasts to go off at a set interval, all on it's own! Once you get it on your server, you are able to open the *config.yml* file to change the settings of the plugin. This is where you can edit the prefix shown before each broadcast message, the messages themselves, and the interval at which the messages will be sent! You can also use the command *'/bcast'* to manually send a message to the server!

## Commands
```diff
/bcast <message> → Use to broadcast to the server!
